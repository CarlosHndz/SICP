# Building Abstractions with Procedures

The programming language of choice for this book is Scheme which is a dialect of Lisp. 

* ## Expressions
A simple expression might be just a number. 

The following are *combinations* of numerical expressions within parenthesis. The leftmost element is called the **operator** and the other elements are called **operands**.
```
(+ 127 349)
486
(- 1000 334)
666
(* 5 99)
495
(/ 10 5)
2
(+ 2.7 10)
12.7
```
When the operator is placed on the left of the operands, it is known as *prefix notation*.
